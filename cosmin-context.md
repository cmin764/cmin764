## Core Values

Four virtues guiding life and work:

1. **Move forward** — Even when help is delaying, don't remain blocked. Look for alternatives.
2. **Be transparent** — If you ask me something, I provide value; same I expect from you. No political games.
3. **Stay humble** — Nurture quiet confidence, but don't tolerate brilliant jerks. Facts over opinions.
4. **Less is more** — Ditch calls, context switching and bureaucracy. Make room for focus, curiosity, creativity and innovation.

## Philosophy & Mantras

### On Work

- "Human beings are not meant to sink in tedious repetitive tasks. We're more creative than that."
- "There has to be a simple solution for this." (personal mantra)
- First principles thinking as default approach
- Removing "im" from impossible
- "Languages are just tools, frameworks can be easily learned."
- "Action over deliberation" — learned at Robocorp
- Effectiveness towards end consumer > efficiency metrics
- Impact & results > hours worked
- Quality > vanity metrics

### On Startups (from accelerator programs)

- Being a **firefighter** is impactful
- Can't scale without remaining an **innovator**
- Being a strong **communicator** is essential

### On Self

- "Smart geek with strong technical principles coming from a security-driven background"
- Prefers risky but promising projects over steady-growth corporate life
- "I can name a lot of geniuses way better than me at building apps and deploying APIs... but not sure how many can resist the pressure of a startup, adapt fast to change and carefully asking the 'why' more often than the 'how' and 'what'."

**Favorite quote:** "Do. Or do not. There is no try." — Yoda

---

## Career Aspirations

- "Founder mode" with genuine leadership influence and people management
- Growing multifunctional cohesive autonomous teams in remote-first async setups
- Senior backend/solutions/lead engineer moving the needle
- Intrapreneur trajectory — being a partner rather than just an employee
- Contributing to innovation and growth, not just execution
