## Core Values

Four virtues guiding life and work:

1. **Move forward** — Even when help is delaying, don't remain blocked. Look for alternatives.
2. **Be transparent** — If you ask me something, I provide value; same I expect from you. No political games.
3. **Stay humble** — Nurture quiet confidence, but don't tolerate brilliant jerks. Facts over opinions.
4. **Less is more** — Ditch calls, context switching and bureaucracy. Make room for focus, curiosity, creativity and innovation.

## Philosophy & Inner Navigation

### The Three-Layer Journey

A personal framework inspired by Mesoamerican wisdom, representing the arc from foundation through transformation to infinite innovation:

| Layer | Civilization | Principle | Application |
|-------|--------------|-----------|-------------|
| **Foundation** | Maya | First principles, mathematical thinking, breaking things apart to understand | Start with the essential need, expand only as necessary. Build from a point outward. |
| **Transformation** | Inca | Synthesis, adaptation, free movement, reading the living landscape | The wisdom between structure and output. Adapt, integrate, connect disparate elements. |
| **Innovation** | Aztec | Eternal return with variation, infinite scalability, transforming inherited knowledge | Each iteration is progression. Moving forward while appearing to cycle back. |

### The Six Powers (Inca Constellation)

A navigation system for different moments in life and work:

| Symbol | Energy | When It Activates |
|--------|--------|-------------------|
| **Inti** (Sun) | Core creative fire, renewable energy, radiating from within | Early morning deep work. Creating value that regenerates daily (solar) vs. depleting resources (coal). Shining because it's your nature, not in response to anything. |
| **Chakana** (Cosmic Cross) | Decision-making framework across three levels | Evaluating opportunities: Does it honor where I came from? Serve present needs? Build toward the vision? The void in its center is space for innovation between structure and chaos. |
| **Condor** (Spiral Heart) | Elevated perspective, iterative wisdom, patience | Rising above challenges to see bigger patterns. Returning to problems at higher levels. Compound growth through patience, not frantic activity. |
| **Mama Killa** (Moon) | Reflection, processing, transforming experience into wisdom | After intense sprints, pause and digest. The difference between earning money and building wealth. Evening connections that become lifelong relationships. |
| **Mama Qucha** (Water) | Flow, adaptation, connecting distant shores | Finding ways around obstacles rather than forcing through. Smooth transitions between contexts. Adaptation is more powerful than resistance. |
| **Pachamama** (Earth) | Grounding, abundance thinking, sustainable cultivation | Wealth is cultivated like a garden, not extracted. Staying rooted while moving. True wealth includes health, connections, experiences — not just bank balances. |

### Operational Principles

**On Work:**

- "Human beings are not meant to sink in tedious repetitive tasks. We're more creative than that."
- "There has to be a simple solution for this." (personal mantra)
- First principles thinking as default approach
- Removing "im" from impossible
- "Languages are just tools, frameworks can be easily learned."
- "Action over deliberation" — learned at Robocorp
- Effectiveness towards end consumer > efficiency metrics
- Impact & results > hours worked
- Quality > vanity metrics
- Renewable value creation > extractive transactions

**On Startups (from accelerator programs):**

- Being a **firefighter** is impactful
- Can't scale without remaining an **innovator**
- Being a strong **communicator** is essential

**On Self:**

- "Smart geek with strong technical principles coming from a security-driven background"
- Prefers risky but promising projects over steady-growth corporate life
- "I can name a lot of geniuses way better than me at building apps and deploying APIs... but not sure how many can resist the pressure of a startup, adapt fast to change and carefully asking the 'why' more often than the 'how' and 'what'."
- Radiating from core vs. reflecting others' energy
- Carrying light, not seeking it — making the invisible visible, the complex simple, the tedious creative

**Favorite quote:** "Do. Or do not. There is no try." — Yoda

## Career Aspirations

- "Founder mode" with genuine leadership influence and people management
- Growing multifunctional cohesive autonomous teams in remote-first async setups
- Senior backend/solutions/lead engineer moving the needle
- Intrapreneur trajectory — being a partner rather than just an employee
- Contributing to innovation and growth, not just execution
