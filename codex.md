## Core Values

Four virtues guiding life and work:

1. **Move forward** — Even when help is delaying, don't remain blocked. Look for alternatives.
2. **Be transparent** — If you ask me something, I provide value; same I expect from you. No political games.
3. **Stay humble** — Nurture quiet confidence, but don't tolerate brilliant jerks. Facts over opinions.
4. **Less is more** — Ditch calls, context switching and bureaucracy. Make room for focus, curiosity, creativity and innovation.

## Philosophy & Inner Navigation

### The Three-Layer Journey

A personal framework inspired by Mesoamerican wisdom, representing the arc from foundation through transformation to infinite innovation:

| Layer | Civilization | Principle | Application |
|-------|--------------|-----------|-------------|
| **Foundation** | Maya | First principles, mathematical thinking, breaking things apart to understand | Start with the essential need, expand only as necessary. Build from a point outward. |
| **Transformation** | Inca | Synthesis, adaptation, free movement, reading the living landscape | The wisdom between structure and output. Adapt, integrate, connect disparate elements. |
| **Innovation** | Aztec | Eternal return with variation, infinite scalability, transforming inherited knowledge | Each iteration is progression. Moving forward while appearing to cycle back. |

### The Six Powers (Inca Constellation)

A navigation system for different moments in life and work:

| Symbol | Energy | When It Activates |
|--------|--------|-------------------|
| **Inti** (Sun) | Core creative fire, renewable energy, radiating from within | Early morning deep work. Creating value that regenerates daily (solar) vs. depleting resources (coal). Shining because it's your nature, not in response to anything. |
| **Chakana** (Cosmic Cross) | Decision-making framework across three levels | Evaluating opportunities: Does it honor where I came from? Serve present needs? Build toward the vision? The void in its center is space for innovation between structure and chaos. |
| **Condor** (Spiral Heart) | Elevated perspective, iterative wisdom, patience | Rising above challenges to see bigger patterns. Returning to problems at higher levels. Compound growth through patience, not frantic activity. |
| **Mama Killa** (Moon) | Reflection, processing, transforming experience into wisdom | After intense sprints, pause and digest. The difference between earning money and building wealth. Evening connections that become lifelong relationships. |
| **Mama Qucha** (Water) | Flow, adaptation, connecting distant shores | Finding ways around obstacles rather than forcing through. Smooth transitions between contexts. Adaptation is more powerful than resistance. |
| **Pachamama** (Earth) | Grounding, abundance thinking, sustainable cultivation | Wealth is cultivated like a garden, not extracted. Staying rooted while moving. True wealth includes health, connections, experiences — not just bank balances. |

### Operational Principles

**On Work:**

- "Human beings are not meant to sink in tedious repetitive tasks. We're more creative than that."
- "There has to be a simple solution for this." (personal mantra)
- First principles thinking as default approach
- Removing "im" from impossible
- "Languages are just tools, frameworks can be easily learned."
- "Action over deliberation" — learned at Robocorp
- Effectiveness towards end consumer > efficiency metrics
- Impact & results > hours worked
- Quality > vanity metrics
- Renewable value creation > extractive transactions

**On Startups (from accelerator programs):**

- Being a **firefighter** is impactful
- Can't scale without remaining an **innovator**
- Being a strong **communicator** is essential

**On Leadership:**

- **Mandate vs. lead by example** — The sweet spot lies between "my way or the highway" and endless voting that never reaches agreement. Brainstorm, offer options, but be the leader who draws the line and sets the path forward.
- **No responsibility without authority** — I don't take responsibility for outcomes I can't influence. Otherwise I'm just your scapegoat on a sinking ship.
- **Hire me to tell you what to do, not the other way around** — If you need someone to execute orders, that's not me. Hire experts for their judgment.
- **If you hire me to just code, I'm sorry, that's for Claude Code** — Pure execution is commoditized. I bring strategic value, not keystrokes.

**On Self:**

- "Smart geek with strong technical principles coming from a security-driven background"
- Prefers risky but promising projects over steady-growth corporate life
- "I can name a lot of geniuses way better than me at building apps and deploying APIs... but not sure how many can resist the pressure of a startup, adapt fast to change and carefully asking the 'why' more often than the 'how' and 'what'."
- **Diamonds are built under pressure** — Thriving in high-stakes environments where others crack. Pressure reveals character and forges clarity.
- Radiating from core vs. reflecting others' energy
- Carrying light, not seeking it — making the invisible visible, the complex simple, the tedious creative

**Favorite quote:** "Do. Or do not. There is no try." — Yoda

---

## Career Aspirations

- "Founder mode" with genuine leadership influence and people management
- Growing multifunctional cohesive autonomous teams in remote-first async setups
- Senior backend/solutions/lead engineer moving the needle
- Intrapreneur trajectory — being a partner rather than just an employee
- Contributing to innovation and growth, not just execution

---

## Strategic Positioning

> A fractional AI product strategist who happens to be a world-class Python engineer, running a distributed company structure that generates consulting revenue while building a community-driven talent business, with a long-term trajectory toward investment and IP licensing — all from wherever I happen to wake up.

### Multi-Entity Architecture

| Entity | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| **Wandercode** | Premium consulting (1-2 clients, $100-300+/hr). Embedded in client teams but sovereign. |
| **Driftware Dynamics** | Holds NoMoreApply, provides management services to Wandercode. Cyprus non-dom structure. |
| **NoMoreApply** | Long game. Trust-based talent network. Revenue while sleeping. |

**Core Insight:** Not building a career. Building an **asset portfolio** where each piece feeds the others.

### The Operator → Allocator Transition

Angel Squad (Hustle Fund) application signals repositioning from selling time to deploying judgment. From coding room to problem-definition room.

### Geographic Arbitrage as Strategy

The nomad pattern isn't lifestyle — it's proving: "I am the product, not my location." Cyprus 60-day rule, HK quarterly dividends, Airwallex/Wise/Revolut banking stack — optionality at every layer.

### Blugen as Scalable IP

Blueprint-driven code generation (Claude Code + Cursor + MCPs). AI amplifies systematized thinking. Teachable (workshops $15-250K), licensable, moat in client engagements. Selling outcomes, not hours.

### The Positioning Gap

> The companies interviewed me for engineering roles. What they should've hired me for is figuring out which engineering problems are worth solving in the first place.

- **Zambia** — Helicopter ride above Victoria Falls; walked with rhinos face-to-face in a protected area, guards nearby watching for poachers
