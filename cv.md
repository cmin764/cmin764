# Cosmin Poieana

*Engineer at core | Entrepreneur at heart*

Human beings aren't meant for tedious repetitive tasks. We're more creative than that.

AI handles the repetition. Humans fill the gaps that need judgment. That's the split, and it's how we should build.

Sr. Software Engineer with business and leadership chops. Drawn to startups, photography, art, reading, and traveling (50+ countries as a digital nomad). Impact and results over hours logged.

3. *Software Engineering Lead* @ **Sema4AI**, USA: Nov 2023 - Jul 2024 (9 months)

    As a cohesive team of 5 Python engineers, we established the foundation of running [AI Actions](https://github.com/Sema4AI/gallery) through OpenGPT-powered Agents. At the core of the framework, a server ([Action Server](https://github.com/Sema4AI/actions)) built on FastAPI discovers packages exposing actions to run locally in isolation. The "meat" of these actions is pure Python logic operating over internal and external resources. We built the "hands & legs" of the AI: execution after reasoning.

    - Bridged product and engineering by managing a Linear project for creating pre-made actions wrapping Google, Slack, HubSpot, and local document operations.
    - Wrote technical documents for issue scoping and designed the OAuth2 flow for our products.
    - Improved the DX of library work and its migration from RPA to native Python automation.
    - People management: hiring interview code challenge design, 360 reviews, 1on1 proactive feedback, new hires onboarding, team autonomy & trust empowerment.
    - Held talks about our development tools and Python automation to wider external audiences.

    Hired strong engineers and built a subteam around Python development and CI/CD best practices. Grew as a manager by learning to reduce friction, nurture autonomy, and keep the roadmap flexible when the product kept shifting. This role came from Robocorp's acquisition by Sema4AI, a full rebrand that pushed me into leadership.

## V. About Me

Born in Romania (Focșani, 1993). Started by breaking electronics apart to understand how they worked. Physics came next: national olympiad honors in mechanics, optics, and quantum. Then someone saw my Batch scripts and said: *"Without a real programming language, you're like a lion in a cage."*

That led me to **Python** in 2007. The first 6 non-professional years taught me as much as the 13 professional ones. I never gave up social life, sports, or pushing past comfort zones.
