# Cosmin Poieana

*Engineer at core | Entrepreneur at heart*

Human beings aren't meant for tedious repetitive tasks. We're more creative than that.

AI handles the repetition. Humans fill the gaps that need judgment. That's the split — and it's how we should build.

Sr. Software Engineer with business and leadership chops. Passionate about startups, photography, videography, art, reading, and traveling (50+ countries as a digital nomad). Impact and results over hours logged.

3. *Software Engineering Lead* @ **Sema4AI**, USA: Nov 2023 - Jul 2024 (9 months)

    As a cohesive team of 5 Python engineers, we established the foundation of running [AI Actions](https://github.com/Sema4AI/gallery) through OpenGPT-powered Agents. At the core of the framework, there's a server ([Action Server](https://github.com/Sema4AI/actions)) built over FastAPI capable of discovering packages exposing actions to be run locally in isolation. The "meat" of these actions is pure Python logic which operates over both internal and external resources. We are building the "hands & legs" of the AI, so it can execute tasks post-reasoning.

    - Bridged the product with the engineering side by managing a Linear project dealing with the creation of pre-made actions, wrapping services like Google, Slack, HubSpot and operating on local documents.
    - Wrote technical documents helping with issue scoping and designed the OAuth2 flow affecting our products.
    - Improved the DX of library work and its migration from RPA to native Python automation.
    - People management: hiring interview code challenge design, 360 reviews, 1on1 proactive feedback, new hires onboarding, team autonomy & trust empowerment.
    - Held talks about our development tools and Python automation to wider external audiences.

    Hired strong engineers and built a subteam around Python development and CI/CD best practices. Grew as a manager by learning to reduce friction, nurture autonomy, and keep the roadmap flexible when the product kept shifting. This role came from Robocorp's acquisition by Sema4AI — a full rebrand that pushed me into leadership.

## IV. Bragging Rights

1. Co-Founded [TrueStory](https://github.com/savvybit/), a news aggregator offering you similar, but contradictory stories for the same subject that you're reading.

2. During college, I've successfully designed and implemented a mobile [application](https://github.com/cmin764/morseus) able to intercept and live decode intermittent light emitting sources as Morse code into text with adaptive automatic calibration.

3. I've succeeded in implementing in a few weeks a fully working and robust application offering CLI and GUI support, able to analyze, parse, decompose and model PDF objects for hiding data into them. Encrypted or not, the information was concealed using a unique steganography method based on content representation states, resulting in a perfect valid and normal PDF file as output, displaying the very same interpreted content. (studied in depth the PDF file format)

4. Had my first international presentation at EuroPython 2015 in Bilbao, Spain about an open-source CI generic-purpose system on top of OpenStack and tempest.

5. First time as a speaker, at a local conference, I've talked about the security risks of evaluating data from untrusted sources inside software, with real-life examples of attacker vs. victim cases. This was followed by a second speech in the next year, about steganographic methods of hiding data in usual files.

6. Together with two friends and co-workers, I've managed to create a brand called [RoPython](https://ropython.ro/), officially approved and sponsored by PSF, through which we've organized regional conferences, workshops and talk sessions targeting students and not only.

7. Been part of the jury team at a national projects contest called InfoEducatie in 2014 (sponsored by Google), where I've designed an open challenge for transmitting data between two devices without using conventional technology.

8. Passed the entire hiring process and elaborate psychological interview at DarkMatter, UAE.

9. Had my first job right after entering college at a top antivirus company worldwide, Bitdefender.

10. At the age of 16, I had my first commission by implementing a fast CLI script able to simulate dictionary attacks and pen-tests over open VNC servers. The intention is to find working credentials which would expose the vulnerability in order to fix it. Afterwards, I've created a solution of doing the same over RDP servers without studying the protocol, but instead using telnet reverse connections for checking if the current pair was a match. (studied the RFB protocol and various RDP clients)

11. Created a CLI secure chat with basic AES encryption over RSA handshake.

12. Created scripts in high school with GUIs using Tkinter for:

    - discovering and testing vulnerabilities like LFI, RFI and SQLi (pentesting)
    - generating valid social ID numbers (educational & validation purposes)
    - searching over the web for answers to questions at online Oracle tests (high-school project)
    - passing and reversing data through a couple of hashing, encoding and encryption algorithms
    - hiding and revealing information in pictures using the LSB method and standard encryption
    - blocking certain web pages on local host by managing the *hosts* file
    - key-generators for car equipments by reverse-engineering math functions (service debugging)

13. Learning all by myself and been motivated since 2007 by security forums like darkc0de, rstcenter/rstforums, mortal-team and many great people around the globe.

## V. About Me

Born in Romania (Focșani, 1993). Started by breaking electronics apart to understand how they worked. Physics came next — national olympiad honors in mechanics, optics, and quantum. Then someone saw my Batch scripts and said: *"Without a real programming language, you're like a lion in a cage."*

That led me to **Python** in 2007. The first 6 non-professional years taught me as much as the 13 professional ones. I never gave up social life, sports, or pushing past comfort zones.
