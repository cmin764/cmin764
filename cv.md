# Cosmin Poieana

*Engineer at core | Entrepreneur at heart*

I truly believe that human beings are not meant to sink in tedious repetitive tasks. We're more creative than that.

This way we can leverage the power of AI when it comes to automation, by filling only the system logical gaps with human technical expertise, leaving the LLM do the rest. I'm sure that we're ready to shape the future by riding this wave, while employing an ethical upright culture.

So here I am, a Sr. Software Engineer seasoned with business and leadership skills. Passionate about startups, photography, videography, art, reading and traveling the world, as an effective digital nomad focusing on impact and results.

## I. Experience

Also contributing with tax guidance and optimization strategies for digital nomads.

3. *Software Engineering Lead* @ **Sema4AI**, USA: Nov 2023 - Jul 2024 (9 months)

    As a cohesive team of 5 Python engineers, we established the foundation of running AI Actions through OpenGPT-powered Agents. At the core of the framework, there's a server built over FastAPI capable of discovering packages exposing actions to be run locally in isolation. The "meat" of these actions is pure Python logic which operates over both internal and external resources.

    - Bridged the product with the engineering side by managing a Linear project dealing with the creation of pre-made actions, wrapping services like Google, Slack, HubSpot and operating on local documents.
    - Written technical documents helping with issue scoping and designed the OAuth2 flow affecting our products.
    - Improved the DX of library work and its migration from RPA to native Python automation.
    - People management: hiring interview code challenge design, 360 reviews, 1on1 proactive feedback, new hires onboarding, team autonomy & trust empowerment.
    - Held talks about our development tools and Python automation to wider external audiences.

    Managed to interview and hire some of the best fits at that time, while assembling a subteam focusing around Python development and CI/CD best practices for package releasing. Experienced growth on the management side by diminishing friction, nurture autonomy and keeping the roadmap in sync with the volatile nature of the product. This was a full rebrand of myself aligning with the acquisition of Robocorp by Sema4AI.

4. *Senior Software Engineer* @ **Robocorp**, Finland: Sep 2021 - Oct 2023 (2 years 2 months)

## IV. Bragging Rights

1. Co-Founded [TrueStory](https://github.com/savvybit/), a news aggregator offering you similar, but contradictory stories for the same subject that you're reading.

2. During college, I've successfully designed and implemented a mobile [application](https://github.com/cmin764/morseus) able to intercept and live decode intermittent light emitting sources as Morse code into text with adaptive automatic calibration.

3. I've succeeded in implementing in a few weeks a fully working and robust application offering CLI and GUI support, able to analyze, parse, decompose and model PDF objects for hiding data into them. Encrypted or not, the information was concealed using a unique steganography method based on content representation states, resulting in a perfect valid and normal PDF file as output, displaying the very same interpreted content. (studied in depth the PDF file format)

4. Had my first international presentation at EuroPython 2015 in Bilbao, Spain about an open-source CI generic-purpose system on top of OpenStack and tempest.

5. First time as a speaker, at a local conference, I've talked about the security risks of evaluating data from untrusted sources inside software, with real-life examples of attacker vs. victim cases. This was followed by a second speech in the next year, about steganographic methods of hiding data in usual files.

6. Together with two friends and co-workers, I've managed to create a brand called [RoPython](https://ropython.ro/), officially approved and sponsored by PSF, through which we've organized regional conferences, workshops and talk sessions targeting students and not only.

7. Been part of the jury team at a national projects contest called InfoEducatie in 2014 (sponsored by Google), where I've designed an open challenge for transmitting data between two devices without using conventional technology.

8. Passed the entire hiring process and elaborate psychological interview at DarkMatter, UAE.

9. Had my first job right after entering college at a top antivirus company worldwide, Bitdefender.

10. At the age of 16, I had my first commission by implementing a fast CLI script able to simulate dictionary attacks and pen-tests over open VNC servers. The intention is to find working credentials which would expose the vulnerability in order to fix it. Afterwards, I've created a solution of doing the same over RDP servers without studying the protocol, but instead using telnet reverse connections for checking if the current pair was a match. (studied the RFB protocol and various RDP clients)

11. Created a CLI secure chat with basic AES encryption over RSA handshake.

12. Created scripts in high school with GUIs using Tkinter for:

    - discovering and testing vulnerabilities like LFI, RFI and SQLi (pentesting)
    - generating valid social ID numbers (educational & validation purposes)
    - searching over the web for answers to questions at online Oracle tests (high-school project)
    - passing and reversing data through a couple of hashing, encoding and encryption algorithms
    - hiding and revealing information in pictures using the LSB method and standard encryption
    - blocking certain web pages on local host by managing the *hosts* file
    - key-generators for car equipments by reverse-engineering math functions (service debugging)

13. Learning all by myself and been motivated since 2007 by security forums like darkc0de, rstcenter/rstforums, mortal-team and many great people around the globe.

## V. About Me

I was born in Romania (Focsani, Vrancea) on 26th of April 1993 and since childhood I had a passion for electronics. Learning how things are working by breaking them into smaller components, while trying to figure out how they function separately and altogether. Then, I proceeded further to something more practical by earning a strong background in physics (newtonian mechanics, optics, calorimetry, electrostatic and quantum mechanics), with which I was obtaining honors in national contests and olympics. After that, I was very eager to implement cool ideas and express my thoughts by inventing and creating practical things, so I was getting slowly into the programming world, where my baby steps were to write "help" into the CMD line prompt and gluing out commands together. I really wish to say "thank you" to the person that once said to me: *"Without a real programming language, you're like a lion in a cage."* when saw my first scripts in Batch. That led me to **Python**, and this was the beginning of my whole experience described above, including what will follow.

My passion for this language began in 2007 and still continues today, where the first 6 non-professional years of activity had the same impact on me in terms of learning, discovering and accomplishments as the rest of the professional ones had. Despite all of these, my fulfilment is that I was not giving up on my social life, sports and healthy lifestyle, with a focus on overcoming my area of comfort every time I could.
