# 👋 Hi there! I'm Cosmin Poieana

## 🚀 *Engineer at core | Entrepreneur at heart*

Building AI-driven **automation solutions**, scalable **SaaS backends**, and APIs that let businesses focus on creativity instead of bureaucracy.
A [digital nomad](./travel.md) (50+ countries) with 18+ years of Python expertise. I build enterprise-grade systems where technical depth meets real business needs.

🌟 *"Human beings are not meant to sink in tedious repetitive tasks. We're more creative than that."*

🤝 *[Work with me](https://wandercode.ltd/)*

## 🔧 Preferred stack

### AI & Automation

- LLM/GPT integration, Robot Framework, RPA libraries
- Web/desktop automation, OCR, intelligent document processing

### Backend

- **Core**: Python (FastAPI/Flask, SQLModel)
- **Secondary**: Go, TypeScript (Node.js, Express.js/NestJS, Prisma), C/C++
- **Communication**: REST, WebSocket, GraphQL, gRPC, Rabbit|ZeroMQ, Kafka

### Frontend

- **Core**: HTML + Jinja2, JavaScript + jQuery, CSS + Bootstrap/Tailwind
- **Secondary**: React/Next.js

### Databases

- PostgreSQL, MySQL
- Redis, MongoDB, ElasticSearch

### DevOps & Cloud

- Docker, Compose/Swarm, Kubernetes (Helm), Terraform, ArgoCD
- AWS, GCP (App Engine, Functions, Firestore), Heroku, Vercel
- OpenTelemetry, Prometheus, Grafana (Loki, Tempo)

### How I Work

- **Embedded operator:** I integrate into your Slack, GitHub, standups. Not a vendor on the outside; part of the team without the payroll.
- **Blueprint-first:** Research, plan, execute. Front-load the design with AI tooling so code ships with confidence.
- **Value over hours:** Outcomes-based pricing tied to business impact. Expertise creates compression, not expansion.
- **Fast iterations:** Ship early, gather feedback, refine. Small batches over big bangs.
- **AI culture catalyst:** I don't just use AI tools — I bring the team along. Shared conventions, live results over policy memos, and engineering practices that outlast my engagement.
